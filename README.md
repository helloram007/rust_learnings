This is a Page for Rust Learnings.
Rust is not the easiest programming language to learn…
So it’s crucial that you know about the high-quality learning resources.

Here are some popular free Rust learning resources:

[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) (aka “The Book” or “The Rust Book”)
   * The official technical book for learning Rust.
   * Perfect for Rust beginners that have some programming background.
   * I’ve made a YouTube playlist going through the entire book.
[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example)
   * Runnable code examples covering similar topics as The Rust Book.
   * Perfect for Rust beginners that prefer to learn by coding along.


[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
   * An open-source collection of Rust specific exercises.
   * Intentionally faulty Rust code that won’t compile, and your job is to debug and fix them.
   * Perfect for hands-on practice and building intuition on how the Rust compiler works.

[Rust Standard Library Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std)
   * Official documentation for the Rust standard library.
   * Fantastic for learning how fundamental Rust concepts are implemented and how to write idiomatic Rust code.
   * Great for Rust learners who prefer reading docs or want to get a deeper understanding of the language.

[Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)
   * A browser interface to the Rust compiler to experiment with the language.
   * You can try out Rust without downloading the runtime or an IDE.
   * Often used to export code snippets for demonstration purposes.
Other Rust books I’ve read (honorable mentions)
   * [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook) - a collection of idiomatic Rust patterns/examples
   * [Rust Design Patterns](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html) - common design patterns implemented in Rust
   * [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html) - recommendations on how to design APIs in Rust
   * [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/) - a free Rust course developed by the Android team at Google
