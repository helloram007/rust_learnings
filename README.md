This is a Page for Rust Learnings.
Rust is not the easiest programming language to learn…



So it’s crucial that you know about the high-quality learning resources.



Here are some popular free Rust learning resources:



The Rust Programming Language (aka “The Book” or “The Rust Book”)



The official technical book for learning Rust.
Perfect for Rust beginners that have some programming background.
I’ve made a YouTube playlist going through the entire book.


Rust by Example



Runnable code examples covering similar topics as The Rust Book.
Perfect for Rust beginners that prefer to learn by coding along.


Rustlings



An open-source collection of Rust specific exercises.
Intentionally faulty Rust code that won’t compile, and your job is to debug and fix them.
Perfect for hands-on practice and building intuition on how the Rust compiler works.


Rust Standard Library Reference



Official documentation for the Rust standard library.
Fantastic for learning how fundamental Rust concepts are implemented and how to write idiomatic Rust code.
Great for Rust learners who prefer reading docs or want to get a deeper understanding of the language.


Rust Playground



A browser interface to the Rust compiler to experiment with the language.
You can try out Rust without downloading the runtime or an IDE.
Often used to export code snippets for demonstration purposes.


Other Rust books I’ve read (honorable mentions)



The Rust Cookbook - a collection of idiomatic Rust patterns/examples
Rust Design Patterns - common design patterns implemented in Rust
Rust API Guidelines - recommendations on how to design APIs in Rust
Comprehensive Rust - a free Rust course developed by the Android team at Google
